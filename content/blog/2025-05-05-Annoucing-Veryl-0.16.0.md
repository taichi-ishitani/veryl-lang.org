title = "Announcing Veryl 0.16.0"
+++

The Veryl team has published a new release of Veryl, 0.16.0.
Veryl is a new hardware description language as an alternate to SystemVerilog.

If you have a previous version of Veryl installed via `verylup`, you can get the latest version with:

```
$ verylup update
```

If you don't have it already, you can get `verylup` from [release page](https://github.com/veryl-lang/verylup/releases/latest).

# Breaking Changes

To migrate some syntax changes, `veryl migrate` can be used:

<details>

```console
// Check how changes will be applied
$ veryl migrate --check

// Migrate
$ veryl migrate
```

</details>

## Keep directory hierarchy for `target = {type = "directory"}` {{ pr(id="1513") }}

`target = {type = "directory"}` caused to break files which have the same name and belong different source directory, because it forces all output files to a single directory.
To avoid this issue, the behaviour of this option is changed to keep directory hierarchy of source.

## Change clock domain annotation symbol to `'` {{ pr(id="1517") }}

Clock domain annotation symbol was `` ` `` by parser restriction.
But it is changed to `'` as the same as Rust's lifetime annotation by improving parser implementation.

```veryl
// Before
i_clk: input `a clock,

// After
i_clk: input 'a clock,
```

## Unsupport `enum` / `struct` / `union` declarations in interface declaration {{ pr(id="1521") }}

`enum`, `struct` and `union` in interface declaration were removed because they can't be refered from the outside of the interface.
If you use them, please move them to a package.

## Typed generic boundary {{ pr(id="1548") }}

`const` as generic boundary was removed, and typed generic boundary is introduced.
This is because `const` can't express a boundary for `enum`.
`veryl migrate` converts all `const` to `u32` boundary.

```veryl
// Before
package PkgA::<X: const, Y: const> {}

// After
package PkgA::<X: u32, Y: EnumX> {}
```

## Forbid last item with ifdef in comma-separated list {{ pr(id="1572") }}

The last item with `ifdef` in comma-separated list becomes to be forbidden.
This is because adjusting last comma by complex `ifdef` combination is difficult.

```veryl
module ModuleA (
    a: input logic,
    #[ifdef(B)] // this `ifdef` is forbidden
    b: input logic,
) {}
```

## Forbid project name starting with `__` {{ pr(id="1580") }}

A project name starting with `__` becomes to be forbidden, because it is used for Veryl compiler internally.

```console
$ veryl new __a
Error:   Ã— project name "__a" is reserved by system
```


# New Language Features

## `elsif` / `else` attribute {{ pr(id="1453") }}

`elsif` and `else` attribute can be used with `ifdef` or `ifndef`.

```veryl
always_comb {
    #[ifdef(DEFINE_A)]
    a = 1;
    #[elsif(DEFINE_B)]
    b = 1;
    #[else]
    c = 1;
}
```

## Proto alias declaration {{ pr(id="1473") }}

`alias` can be used in proto declaration.

```veryl
proto package ProtoPackageA {
    alias module InstModule: ProtoModuleA;
}
package PackageA::<M: ProtoModuleA> for ProtoPackageA {
    alias module InstModule = M;
}
```

## Modport expansion {{ pr(id="1512") }}

Some synthesis tools don't support `modport` as ports of the top module or boundary of hiererchical synthesis.
For such cases, if `#[expand(modport)]` is specified, Veryl compiler expands `modport` of the module.

```veryl
#[expand(modport)]
module ModuleA (
    slv_if: modport InterfaceA::slave ,
    mst_if: modport InterfaceA::master,
) {}
```

## Skip to write files if no change {{ pr(id="1518") }}

If the existing generated files have the same contents which Veryl compiler is trying to emit, writing files is skipped.
By this change, the compatibility with timestamp based tools like GNU make is improved. 

## Default project structure {{ pr(id="1531") }}

As the default project structure, `veryl new` will create the following file and directories. 

```
.gitignore
Veryl.toml
src/
target/
```

## Interface prototype {{ pr(id="1532") }}

Interface prototype becomes to be supported like below:

```veryl
proto interface InterfaceA {
  function FuncA(a: input logic, b: input logic) -> logic;

  modport mp {
    FuncA: import,
  }
}
```

## `u8`, `u16`, `i8` and `i16` fixed types {{ pr(id="1537") }}

`u8`, `u16`, `i8` and `i16` become to be supported as primitive types.

```veryl
let a: u8  = 0;
let a: u16 = 0;
let a: i8  = 0;
let a: i16 = 0;
```

## Use modport as function argument {{ pr(id="1554") }}

Now `modport` can be used as function argument.
Veryl compiler expands these modport to separated variables.

```veryl
function FunctionA (
    slv_if: modport InterfaceA::slave ,
    mst_if: modport InterfaceA::master,
) {}
```

## AXI3, AXI4, AXI4-Lite interfaces and prototypes in Veryl standard library {{ pr(id="1577") }}

Generic AXI3, AXI4, AXI4-Lite interfaces are added in Veryl standard library.

```veryl
alias package axi3_pkg = $std::axi3_pkg::<32, 4, 8>;

module ModuleA (
    slv_if: modport $std::axi3_if::<axi3_pkg>::slave,
) {}
```
