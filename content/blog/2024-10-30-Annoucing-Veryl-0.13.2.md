```
$ verylup update

# New Features

## Allow type as expression {{ pr(id="1016") }}

Arbitrary type including built-in types becomes to be able to be used in expression context.
For example, `logic<10>` type can be passed as parameter override.

```veryl
module ModuleA {
    inst x: ModuleB #(
        X: logic<10>
    );
}

module ModuleB #(
    param X: type = logic,
) {}
```

## Shell completion

The supported shells are below:

* Bash
* Elvish

```
verylup completion zsh veryl
```
